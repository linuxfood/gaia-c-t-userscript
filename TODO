TODO List
* Config - open to ideas (Kirin, can you explain your 'lightbox' idea some more?)
* Go back to TT/Go back to C&T (for those of you who do the helpdesk thing)
* Thread navigation
* Per-Thread Ignores (Kirin for the idea)
* Per-Message tagging (for filtering) (Kirin again)
* A toggle to show gists/skitches/etc - sometimes you don't ALWAYS want to see them
* Recognition of @YourUsername and possibly either highlighting/auto-scrolling to that post
* 'e' for "edit my post"
* Multiple post quoting
* 'd' or 'x' for "delete my post"
* Check if any inputs have focus
